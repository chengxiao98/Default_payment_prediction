In my project, I focused on predicting credit card default payments through a supervised learning method, analyzing a dataset that included 30,000 instances across 24 distinct attributes. I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), selected appropriate models, engaged in feature engineering, and fine-tuned hyperparameters using Python's Scikit-learn toolkit. Leveraging a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, I utilized critical factors such as age, education, marital status, average bill amount, and average payment amount to predict customer default payments. My SVM model yielded a test accuracy of 0.82, along with a recall of 0.33 and a precision of 0.68, showcasing its capacity to effectively identify potential defaults while achieving a balanced precision-recall trade-off.
